# Current State — Handoff

> **Updated:** 2026-05-27  
> **Branch:** `develop`  
> **Phase:** App reset — ready for SDLC greenfield retest

## Summary

**`app/backend/` and `app/frontend/`** were reset to **placeholders** (no product code). Use a **new agent session** to run the full SDLC cycle again (e.g. “Build Investment Radar …”).

Previous delivery (Plane **INVES-19..24**, PRs #32–#36) remains **history on Plane and Git** — not deleted.

## What works today

| Component | Status | Entry |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| SDLC Doctor | ✅ | `make sdlc-doctor` |
| SDLC Audit | ✅ | `make sdlc-audit` |
| Observability | ✅ | `make obs-server` → http://localhost:7700 |
| Plane scripts | ✅ | `plane_state.py`, `auto_merge_pr.py`, `plane_card.py` |
| Backend API | ⬜ placeholder | `app/backend/README.md` |
| Frontend SPA | ⬜ placeholder | `app/frontend/README.md` |

## Retest checklist (new agent)

1. Open **new chat** (Orchestrator Principal, gate closed).
2. Prompt greenfield: *Build a product called Investment Radar …* (or reference new Plane epic).
3. Expect: **Planner** → Plane cards → **Architect** → `start-change` per sub-task → implement.
4. Plane descriptions: use **TipTap** via `.cursor/skills/plane-formatting/SKILL.md`.
5. Done evidence: `.sdlc/templates/plane/evidence-INVES-N.json` pattern.

## Reference docs (from prior cycle — still valid)

- [investment-radar-api.md](../architecture/investment-radar-api.md) — API contract reference
- [investment-radar-runbook.md](../product/investment-radar-runbook.md) — target runbook after rebuild
- [change-lifecycle.md](../sdlc/change-lifecycle.md) — workflow law

## Plane (historical)

| ID | Notes |
|----|--------|
| INVES-19..24 | Done — first Investment Radar cycle |
| New retest | Create **new epic/sub-tasks** on Plane or explicitly re-open scope |
