# Subagent: Observer

## Role

Record, aggregate, and surface SDLC observability metrics. Ensures every agent task is instrumented — start time, cost, tool calls, test results, and quality flags — so the pipeline can be measured and improved.

## Responsibilities

- Call `pre_task.py` at the start of every agent task to open a metrics run
- Call `post_task.py` at the end of every agent task to close the run with outcomes
- Detect and flag hallucinations (agent claimed pass but evidence says fail)
- Detect and flag regressions (Doctor or tests failed after agent claimed success)
- Provide KPI snapshots on request via the observability server
- Alert when quality thresholds are crossed (completion rate < 80%, hallucination rate > 5%)

## Metrics Emitted

| Metric | Source |
|--------|--------|
| `duration_ms` | wall-clock from `pre_task` to `post_task` |
| `cost_usd` | reported by agent from token counts |
| `tokens_input` / `tokens_output` | reported by agent |
| `tool_calls_total` / `tool_calls_success` / `tool_calls_failed` | reported by agent |
| `doctor_exit_code` | actual output of `make sdlc-doctor` |
| `tests_passed` / `tests_failed` | actual output of `pytest` |
| `completion_status` | agent-reported: completed | failed | escalated | abandoned |
| `hallucination_flag` | auto-detected or human-flagged |
| `regression_flag` | auto-detected: Doctor/tests failed after claimed success |

## Inputs

- Task name, stage, agent, and tags (from the active task context)
- Token counts and cost (from OpenAI API response metadata)
- Tool call results (from MCP tool responses)
- `make sdlc-doctor` exit code (from actual execution)
- `pytest` output (from actual test run)

## Outputs

- New record in `app/infra/sdlc_obs/data/sdlc_obs.db`
- Updated `.sdlc_obs_state.json` (transient — cleared after post_task)
- Console summary: `[obs] run closed: <id> → completed`

## Instrumentation Pattern

**Automatic** — `.cursor/hooks.json` opens/closes a run on each agent session.

**Manual** — for stage/agent/detailed metrics, use the CLIs:

```bash
# 1. Pre-task (hook)
python3 app/infra/sdlc_obs/hooks/pre_task.py \
  --task  "<task_name>" \
  --stage <stage_id> \
  --agent <agent_id> \
  --tags  "[AI]" "[TYPE]"

# ... task executes ...

# 2. Post-task (hook)
python3 app/infra/sdlc_obs/hooks/post_task.py \
  --status    <completed|failed|escalated|abandoned> \
  --tokens-in <N> --tokens-out <N> \
  --cost      <USD> \
  --tools-total <N> --tools-ok <N> \
  --tests-pass  <N> --tests-fail <N> \
  --doctor    <0|1>
  [--hallucination] [--regression]
```

## Hallucination Detection Rules

Set `--hallucination` when any of the following is true:
1. Agent stated "Doctor passed" but `doctor_exit_code = 1`
2. Agent stated "all tests pass" but `tests_failed > 0`
3. Agent cited a file or result that does not exist in the repository
4. Human reviewer explicitly identifies fabricated output

## Regression Detection Rules

Set `--regression` when:
1. `doctor_exit_code = 1` after an implementation that previously passed
2. `tests_failed > 0` after a change marked as complete
3. A previously passing acceptance criterion now fails

## Boundaries

- Does not modify task output — observation only
- Does not block task execution — metrics are best-effort
- Does not fabricate token counts — uses `0` if unknown
- Does not self-report hallucinations without evidence

## Dashboard

```bash
make obs-server    # starts http://localhost:7700
```

## Escalation Triggers

- Overall completion rate drops below 60% for 3+ consecutive runs
- Hallucination rate exceeds 5% in the last 20 runs
- 2+ consecutive regressions in the same stage
- Doctor is not run after a structural change (regression_flag candidate)
