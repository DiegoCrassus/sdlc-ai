## Hooks

| Event | Hook | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `preToolUse` | `sdlc_gate_hook.py` | Blocks protected writes when the session gate is closed or wrong |
| `beforeShellExecution`, `subagentStart` | `sdlc_pre_gateway.py` | Blocks unsafe bypass commands and wrong routed subagents |
| `subagentStop` | `sdlc_post_gateway.py` | Validates handoff and returns to the previous step if evidence is incomplete |
| `sessionStart`, `stop` | `sdlc_obs_session.py` | Emits observability run metrics |

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Validate the repository
make sdlc-doctor

# Run the normal SDLC loop
# Use: @sdlc-run in Cursor chat
```
